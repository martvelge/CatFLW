## Scheme

The 48 cat facial landmarks were introduced in [Finka et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-46330-5) and were specifically chosen for their relationship with underlying musculature and relevance to cat-specific facial Action Units ([CatFACS](https://animalfacs.com/catfacs_new)).
